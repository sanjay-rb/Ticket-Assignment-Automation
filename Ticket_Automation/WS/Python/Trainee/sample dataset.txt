payment - HI I am Sanjay and I am a current user of your product. Recently I was trying to pay my bill but i didn't pay because it was showing for higher billing amounts. I ask you to please resolve my issue as soon as possible.

Billing: - I have been charged the incorrect amount for my internet usage. My contract states I have an allowance per month, but I am being charged daily for each separate connection to the internet.

connection issue  -  The problem began on June 12th, when my Internet went down for several days. I established that the problem was not my computer or the wireless connection, and then contacted you about the service interruption. You claimed you would send a repairman right away. No repairman was sent for another two days.
