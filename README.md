# Ticket-Assignment-Automation

Eliminate manual intervention in ticket creation 
	- Raise a ticket based on the complaint mail 
	- If the details are incomplete (e.g. customer id is missing), send a mail to customer asking for missing details. 
	- Link the subsequent responses from the customer to the original ticket 
	- Recognize the bounced mails and initiate appropriate action 
	- Auto response to template based mails (complaints/queries) ie no free text 
	- Multiple bots/ parallel processing
