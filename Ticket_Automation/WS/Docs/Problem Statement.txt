• Title : Customer support - Automation of ticket creation and response based on the mail (RPA)

Description: Eliminate manual intervention in ticket creation
• Raise a ticket based on the complaint mail
• If the details are incomplete (e.g. customer id is missing), send a mail to customer asking for missing details.
• Link the subsequent responses from the customer to the original ticket
• Recognize the bounced mails and initiate appropriate action
• Auto response to template based mails (complaints/queries) ie no free text
• Multiple bots/ parallel processing
